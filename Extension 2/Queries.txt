1. Creating cast Table
CREATE TABLE cast (
    cast_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    film_id INT NOT NULL,
    person_id INT NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES film(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES people(person_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

2. INSERTING VALUES : 

INSERT INTO movie_cast (film_id, person_id, role) VALUES
